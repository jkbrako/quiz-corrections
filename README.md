### question-8

The following values that are always considered falsey are null, 0, "", undefined, NaN, and false. These are always considered false because these values are considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.


### question-9 

The valid data types in JavaScript are null, undefined, objects, strings, floating-points, symbols, and numbers. This is true because they can be stored in variables. Since JavaScript types are dynamic types, therefore, the same variable can hold multiple valid data types, within the same variable, if they so choose. 
For example:
```
let a = 321 // "a" is defined as numbers
a = "lol"   // "a" can also be defined as a string
```
### question-10

The following statement that declares and initializes a variable called `x` with the value 27 are:
```
let x;
x = 27;
```
'Let' declares and initialized the variable. The second line assigned 27 to variable `x`.

## quiz-5
### question-1

The following are valid logical operators in JavaScript:
```
! 
&&
||
```
The `!` operator means NOT, the `&&` operator means AND and the `||` operator means OR. These operators can be applied to values of any type, including boolean values.

### question-2
For the code
```
let x = 43;
let y = "43";

if ( /* missing condition */ ) {
    console.log("x and y have equivalent values and data types.");
}

if ( /* missing condition */ ) {
    console.log("x and y have different values and data types.");
}
```
The two expressions that satisfy the missing conditions above are:
```
x === y
x !== y
```
x and y have equivalent values and data types so, `x === y` is appropiate as it means x is equql value and type to y. The  second condition is met as x and y have different values and data types so `x !== y` as it means x is not of equal value and type.

### question-3
The following are valid relational operators in JavaScript:
```
==
===
<
<=
>
!==
!=
>=
```
All of these operators perform comparisons between values. For example, If the operands are numbers, perform a numeric comparison.
