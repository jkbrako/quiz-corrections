### question-9 

The valid data types in JavaScript are null, undefined, objects, strings, floating-points, symbols, and numbers. This is true because they can be stored in variables. Since JavaScript types are dynamic types, therefore, the same variable can hold multiple valid data types, within the same variable, if they so choose. 
For example:

let a = 321 // "a" is defined as numbers
a = "lol"   // "a" can also be defined as a string
